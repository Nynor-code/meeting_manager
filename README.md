# Meeting Management System

A Python Flask-based Meeting Management API that supports scheduling, invitations, topic planning, outcomes tracking (actions, decisions, risks), reporting (HTML/PDF), and secure access. Runs with PostgreSQL using Docker and deployable to AWS EC2.

## Features

- üìÖ Schedule and manage meetings with participants, topics, and expected durations
- üìß Email invitations to participants
- üìù Record meeting outcomes: notes, actions, decisions, and risks
- üìà Track status of actions (open, running, closed) and risks (with resolution strategy)
- üßæ Generate HTML and PDF reports
- üîê Basic authentication for protected endpoints
- üê≥ Dockerized for easy deployment with PostgreSQL

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL
- WeasyPrint (for PDF generation)
- Docker + Docker Compose
- SMTP (email sending)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Local SMTP service or SMTP credentials for email sending

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file with the following:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/meetings
EMAIL_SENDER=noreply@example.com
APP_USER=admin
APP_PASS=admin
```

3. Start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

4. Load sample data:

```bash
docker exec -it meeting-api python sample_data.py
```

---

## API Endpoints (example)

- `POST /meetings`: Create a meeting
- `PATCH /meetings/<id>/status`: Update meeting status
- `POST /meetings/<id>/invite`: Invite participants
- `GET /meetings/<id>/report`: View HTML report
- `GET /meetings/<id>/report.pdf`: Download PDF report
- `PATCH /actions/<id>`: Update action status
- `PATCH /risks/<id>`: Update risk status and resolution

Use Basic Auth with `APP_USER` and `APP_PASS` for protected routes.

---

## Deployment on AWS EC2

1. Launch an EC2 instance (Ubuntu recommended)
2. Install Docker & Docker Compose
3. Clone the repo and configure `.env`
4. Run `docker-compose up -d`
5. Open ports 80 or 5000 in security group

---

## To-Do / Roadmap

- Frontend interface with Streamlit or HTML templates
- User login and token-based auth
- Email provider integration (e.g., SMTP2GO, Mailgun)
- CI/CD pipeline
